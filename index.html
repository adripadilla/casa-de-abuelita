        <h2>About Rachel</h2>
        <p>
            For over four decades, <strong>Rachel</strong> has poured her heart into sewing, design, 
            and cooking for her community. From custom-made dresses and quinceañera gowns 
            to handmade tamales and catering for special events, her creativity knows no limits.
        </p>
        <p>
            What began as a small home sewing studio has grown into <strong>Casa de Abuelita</strong> — 
            a place where every stitch and every meal is made with love, tradition, and care.
